        One of the first programs I created was a terminal app in Python called Murder Mystery.
        In the game, you explore a hotel you are staying at where a murder has occurred.
        You chose which hotel guests or staff to speak with and try to find out who the 
        murderer is. Click on the image to solve the mystery!

        One of the more recent applications I've made is a Painter App in the Java language.
        The user has the option to choose the color and size of their brush.
        The color is customizable by red, green, and blue elements and the opacity.
        Click on the Java Painter image to check out this Application!
