        Have you tried turning it off and back on again? As far back as I can remember,
        I've been the go-to for all my family and friends whenever they have a tech issue. 
        I decided to expand on my love of tech and computers and find out how to talk to
        them by getting my Associate's Degree in Computer Science.  After I finished my
        schooling, I started a Java bootcamp at Grand Circus to delve deeper into the
        Java language and learn about more complex coding structures. I'm still in that
        program today and loving every minute!

        Another passion of mine is man's best friend. Sure, cats are cool and birds can
        hold a tune, but no pet compares to a canine in my eyes.  I currently have a sweet
        elderly 15-year-old Lab named Zada and am traversing the world of puppy training with
        a brand spanking new 8-week-old Husky mix named Merlin.  These adorable babes make
        each and every day more enjoyable, albeit challenging.  The transition from a senior
        lab to a puppy husky has been a worldwind but I'm so lucky to be able to watch this
        firecracker grow up.

        The last rounding feature of me is my love of my family.  Spending time with my
        husband of 12 years and our son and daughter is the most important aspect of my life.
        The ebbs and flows of family life definitely keep things interesting, but I shudder
        to think where I'd be without these three amazing human beings in my life.  We love 
        spending time outdoors whether it's camping, hiking, fishing, kayaking or just having
        a picnic.  Catch us ticking off boxes on our wanderlust bucketlist this summer in the
        Appalachian Mountains!
